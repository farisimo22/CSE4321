# cse4321
A project I worked on for my CSE 4321-software testing and maintenance class

PrinttokensTesting

In this project you are required to use control-flow testing to analyze a fault-seeded Java program Printtokens.java, write JUnit test methods to test the faulty program, and fix faults if found.
